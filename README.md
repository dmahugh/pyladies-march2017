This repo contains materials from the PyLadies meetup (co-hosted by PuPPy) on 3/29/2017 entitled "Open Source @ Microsoft."

The presentation covers how Microsoft manages open source at scale, with a focus on the work of the Open Source Programs
Office (OSPO), followed by a few simple examples of how Python's flexibility and developer productivity have been useful
in OSPO's work, even though we're not a Python shop.  (Most of our services are deployed in Node.)
